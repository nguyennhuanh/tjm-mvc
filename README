If you have developed mobile web applications, I'm sure you know jQuery Mobile. As for me, a mobile web-app guy, I am very interested in its supported features as stated in Jquery mobile home page:

"A unified user interface system that works seamlessly across all popular mobile device platforms, built on the rock-solid jQuery and jQuery UI foundation. Focused on a lightweight codebase built on progressive enhancement with a flexible, easily themeable design."
Development would be more convenient if there was a MVC framework which uses jQuery Mobile in its Views. With the above thoughts, I have developed this framework and named it Tenkana Jquery Mobile MVC, or TJM-MVC in short.

Actually, you can treat this framework like a sandbox project or a starter-kit which helps you build a mobile webapp in few minutes. By combining the bright architecture of the MVC pattern with the user friendly interface of Jquery Mobile, TJM-MVC makes building your mobile web application so much more interesting. In addition, TJM-MVC also provides the features essential for web development such as authentication, caching, SEO, theme-based css and more.
