If you have once developed a mobile web-app, I'm sure that you know to Jquery mobile. As for me, a mobile web-app guy, I am very interested in its supported features as stated in Jquery mobile home page: "A unified user interface system that works seamlessly across all popular mobile device platforms, built on the rock-solid jQuery and jQuery UI foundation. Focused on a lightweight codebase built on progressive enhancement with a flexible, easily themeable design."</p>
<p>The development will become more convenient if there is a MVC framework which includes jquery mobile in the V element. With the above thoughts, I have developed this framework and named it Tenkana Jquery Mobile MVC, or you can call it TJM-MVC in short.</p>
<p>Actually, you can treat this framework like a sandbox project or a starter-kit which helps you build a mobile webapp in few minutes.By the combination of the bright architecture of the MVC pattern with user friendly interface of Jquery Mobile, TJM-MVC brings to you interesting time to play with your mobile web-app. In addition, TJM-MVC has also the essential features for web development such as authentication, caching, SEO, theme-based css...

<p>Currently, TJM-MVC is still in alpha phase and is likely to have bugs that need fixing. In the fureture, I would like to add more features to make it more benefit to developers. So I'm looking forward to your comment to imporve it.
